Explain code

1. @submit.prevent
 - When you click the submit button, it stops the page from refreshing.
 - Make the form work smoothy without reloading
  for example code: <form @submit.prevent="">

2. v-model
 - Connects the input field to the data
 - When you type sth, it automatically saves what you typed
  for example code: <input v-model="" placeholder="" required />

3. form.company
 - Just a place to store the company name
 - part of the form data
  for example code: <input v-model="" placeholder="" required />

4. placeholder and required
 - Placeholder: shows helpful text when the field is empty
 - required: Make sure you fill in important information
  for example code: <input v-model="" placeholder="" required />
 
5. textarea and row ="2"
 - textarea: A bigger box for writing longer notes
 - rows="2" : Makes the box 2 line tall
  for example code: <textarea v-model="" placeholder="Notes..." rows="2"></textarea> 

5. div v-if
 - div(division) is the most basic container element in HTML 
 - It's used to group and sturcture other elements 
 - v-if is.. As Vue's directive, "show this element on screen only when this condition is true"
 - v-if="applications.length" -> The list is only displayed on the screen when you register at least one application.
 - v-for="(app, index) in application"
   -> app: current item in array (individual application object)
   -> index: order of the current item in the array (staring from 0)
   -> key="index" : unique identifier for each item 
    so, Repeat each item(app)in applications array, create a div by that number, and use each index as a key to distinguish it uniquelty

=========================================
  for example code: 
  <div v-if="applications.length">
  <div v-for="(app, index) in applications" :key="index">
    <strong>{{ app.company }}</strong> – {{ app.position }}<br />
    Date: {{ app.date }} | Score: {{ app.score }}%<br />
    <em>{{ app.notes }}</em><br />
    <button @click="removeApplication(index)">Delete</button>
  </div>
  </div>
==========================================

if i analyze the entire code above, it is as follows.

1. if there is at least one job application, then show this block
  - v-if="applications.length"

2. loop through each job application in the list. 
  - v-for="(app, index) in applications"
  - app: one job application item
  - index: its number in the list (0, 1, 2...)

3. helps Vue keep track of each item
  - :key="index" -> It’s like giving each row a name or ID.

4. detail function inside the loop
   - show the company name in bold 
     - <strong>{{ app.company }}</strong>
   - show the job position next to it
     - – {{ app.position }}
   - how much this application matches the job
     - Score: {{ app.score }}%
